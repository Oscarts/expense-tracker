# ðŸ‘¥ Shared Google Account Setup Guide

## Simple Multi-User Solution

This guide shows how to set up your expense tracker with a **shared Google account** that your family or team can use together.

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

Instead of complex service account setup, everyone uses the **same Google account credentials** to log in and access the shared expense spreadsheet.

### **Perfect For:**
- âœ… **Families** - Parents and kids all use family Google account
- âœ… **Small teams** - Team members share a project Google account  
- âœ… **Roommates** - Shared household expense tracking
- âœ… **Simple setup** - No complex authentication configuration

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Process (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create or Use Shared Google Account

**Option A: Create New Account**
1. Go to [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
2. Create new account: `familyexpenses@gmail.com` (or similar)
3. Share credentials with family/team members

**Option B: Use Existing Account**
- Use an existing family/team Google account
- Make sure everyone knows the login credentials

### Step 2: Your App is Already Configured!

Your expense tracker is already set up to work with Google Sheets OAuth. No additional configuration needed!

### Step 3: How Everyone Uses It

1. **Visit your app** (deployed Netlify URL)
2. **Add an expense** - this triggers Google login popup
3. **Sign in with shared account** (familyexpenses@gmail.com)
4. **Grant permissions** - allow app to access Google Sheets
5. **Done!** - All expenses automatically sync to shared Google Sheet

### Step 4: Share with Family/Team

1. **Share the app URL** with everyone
2. **Share Google account credentials** (familyexpenses@gmail.com + password)
3. **First person creates the spreadsheet** by adding an expense
4. **Everyone else** just logs in with same account
