# Multi-User Expense Tracking Solutions

## Current Problem
- App tied to personal Google account
- Only you can add expenses (requires your credentials)
- Not suitable for family/team use

## Solution Options

### 🎯 **Option 1: Google Service Account (Recommended)**

**What it does:**
- App authenticates automatically (no user login)
- Anyone can add expenses
- Data saves to shared Google Sheet
- No personal Google credentials needed

**Setup Process:**
1. Create Google Service Account
2. Generate service account key (JSON file)
3. Share Google Sheet with service account email
4. Update app to use service account authentication

**Pros:**
- ✅ No user authentication required
- ✅ Multi-user from day one
- ✅ Automatic Google Sheets sync
- ✅ Works with existing code structure

**Cons:**
- 🔧 One-time setup required
- 📁 Service key file needed in deployment

### 🎯 **Option 2: Simple Backend Database**

**What it does:**
- Replace Google Sheets with database
- Simple user accounts or shared access
- API for adding/viewing expenses
- Optional Google Sheets export

**Tech Stack Options:**
- Supabase (easiest) - PostgreSQL with built-in auth

- Airtable (no-code) - Like Google Sheets but better API

**Pros:**
- ✅ Proper multi-user support
- ✅ Better performance than Google Sheets
- ✅ Real-time updates

**Cons:**

- 💰 May have costs at scale

### 🎯 **Option 3: Hybrid Approach**

## 🔧 **Recommended Implementation: Service Account**

This gives you the best balance of:

- Automatic sync (Google Sheets integration)
- Familiar interface (keeps current app structure)
